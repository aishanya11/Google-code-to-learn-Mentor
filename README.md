## APP Idea
The Idea ðŸ’¡
After I decided to participate in this competition, I had to come up with an idea on which I would build my project upon. I wanted to work on a meaningful and impactful idea. My sister suggested that I should start looking out for problems that people face and that it would be better if I look for them around me, my family, my school or my daily life. I observed a lot of problems but I finally chose one problem that I worked on.

Problem: In my family I have two elder sisters and both of my parents are working. My eldest sister is in college. So every day after school, my other sister and I stay alone at home until our parents come back. Staying alone is not easy. I noticed communication problems that my parents and we face every day around this situation. Some of them are:-
Our parents call us daily to tell us a lot of things like what all is to be done or what things are to be taken care of. Work like watering the plants, washing utensils, fill drinking water and sharing information like today maid will come early or where the food is kept, etc.
In addition to that, we are supposed to follow a routine. Our parents make multiple calls to ensure if weâ€™ve changed our clothes, had food, did our homework and so on. It is a very inconvenient form of communication.
Sometimes they forget to tell us something and more than that we forget what all mummy has asked us to do.
Another problem is that sometimes our parents are not always free to make these calls. Because of this we again face communication problems.
Our parents generally call or message us to give us important reminders like taking some medicine at 4 pm or get ready for the tuitions at 5 pm.
Sometimes we miss calls from our parents (for example if we are sleeping) and likewise, our parents are sometimes not available to take calls which makes them or us worried.

We donâ€™t face the above problems when our parents are at home because they are physically present with us and they just tell us what we have to do and also easily keep a check on us. So I thought of making an Application that creates a sense of your parent's presence when they are not at home, telling us what to do, giving us messages, talking to us and reminding us important things. It lets our parents communicate with us in a more efficient manner according to their convenience.
